For javascript, all the current numbers are w/o considering ___.min.js files.

The repos that did have this were:

	axios
	Font-Awesome
	freeCodeCamp
	jquery
	node
	react

All the results w/ the .min.js files are included in the results folder, though.

There are many javascript repos that still have some sort of minified file, although the
extension did not reflect it. The results for javascript are a bit scattered.
